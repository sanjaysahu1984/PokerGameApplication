POKER
For this program, you will be taking a text input of playing cards and evaluating what the best poker
hand could be constructed with the cards.
For example, given a string input of:
'AS, 10C, 10H, 3D, 3S'
(the cards above are ace of spades, 10 of clubs, 10 of hearts, 3 of diamonds and 3 of spades)
Output would be: 'Two Pair'

For reference, the ten possible poker hands can be found at:
